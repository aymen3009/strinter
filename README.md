# Auto convert string interpolation single quotes/double quotes to backticks

## Description

I am too lazy to convert single quotes or double quotes to backticks when i decide to use string interpolation in my code. This is a simple VSCode extension that does that for me automatically ðŸ˜….

> Note: This extension only works for JavaScript and TypeScript files.

## How it works

- When you type a string interpolation with single quotes or double quotes, the extension will automatically convert it to backticks for you. AS SIMPLE AS THAT!
